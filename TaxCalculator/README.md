Hello Fintranet,
Please run the DBSetup script in SQL Server first to create the database. 
Then copy your connection string into the DefaultConnection field in appsettings.json and run the application.
Since I had limited time, I used only a single repository pattern and did not implement remove and edit operations for the entities.
I hope you enjoy.
